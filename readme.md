# JupyterCon 2017 - My code

This repository is meant to store code that I write as part of tutorials and
other sessions at JupyterCon.

If you're unfamiliar with [jupyter.org](Jupyter), it is a front-end interactive
worksheet based tool for working with Python, Julia, R and other data
science oriented languages.
